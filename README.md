- Improved login validation
- Styling and user experience

TESTING APPLICATION
- Application dashboard and session management is best tested by utilising username: testi with password: testii. This user has a decent amount of logged expenses and incomes so that the functionalities of the dashboard can be observed
- Signup can be tested by creating a new user account and inserting expenses and incomes in your profile when logged in.
